/**
 * Motion presets — the approved vocabulary.
 *
 * Standard: SYSTEM/DESIGN-LANGUAGE/02-MOTION-SYSTEM.md
 *
 * Every preset here replaces a pattern proven in 2+ production sites. Presets
 * return plain Motion prop objects so they can be spread onto any `m.*` element:
 *
 *   <m.div {...fadeUp()}>…</m.div>
 *
 * Each accepts `reduced` so callers can collapse motion at the call site. The
 * MotionProvider also sets `reducedMotion="user"` globally, which suppresses
 * transform/layout animation; passing `reduced` additionally drops the opacity
 * fade, which is what a truly still interface requires.
